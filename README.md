# Schoolio

> classroom management system prototype for teachers and students in primary schools, based on vuejs and electron

Schoolio is a school management system for pupils and teachers in primary schools. Schoolio supports teachers in preparing and conducting digital lessons. It simplifies digital teaching; tasks can be created and distributed quickly and the teacher is constantly receiving feedback on the students' learning success.
Schoolio makes the login process and the complex operation of a computer more accessible to students. A tag can be used to unlock the screen without a password. Students can request help from the teacher by pressing a button. Then the teacher  receives information which student needs help.
